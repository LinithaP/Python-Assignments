7. Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and their corresponding subjects.
The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
Input:       [Sam, Alice, Mona] , [Commerce, Science, Computer] Output:   [Sam: Commerce,  Alice: Science , Mona: Computer]

# using for loop

def name_map(student, sub):
    student_sub = {}
    for student, sub in zip(student,sub):
        student_sub[student] = sub
    return student_sub

print(name_map(["Sam", "Alice", "Mona"],["Commerce", "Science", "Computer"]))


#using dictionary comprehension:

def name_mapping(student, sub):
    return {student: sub for student, sub in zip(student, sub)}

print(name_mapping(["Sam", "Alice", "Mona"],["Commerce", "Science", "Computer"]))
